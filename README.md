Reparametrized Inverse Gaussian distribution estimation for real-time systems

This work is an implementation of the work of Antonio Punzo (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02664763.2018.1542668) and an adaptation for the estimation of response times of real-time systems using fixed-priority scheduling policies.
